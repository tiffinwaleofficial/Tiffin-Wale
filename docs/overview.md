# TiffinWale Student App - Overview

## Purpose and Vision

TiffinWale Student App is a specialized mobile application designed to address the food needs of students and young professionals living away from home. The app provides a streamlined platform for subscribing to regular meal plans, tracking daily food deliveries, and managing meal subscriptions.

The core vision is to ensure that students and working youth have access to quality, affordable, and consistent homestyle meals without the hassle of daily food preparation or the expense and health concerns associated with frequent restaurant dining or food delivery.

## Target Users

- **College/University Students**: Living in hostels, PG accommodations, or shared apartments with limited cooking facilities.
- **Bachelor Professionals**: Young working professionals who have recently relocated to a new city for work and lack the time or facilities to cook regular meals.
- **Working Youth**: Individuals balancing work and studies who need reliable meal solutions to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## Core Problem Solved

1. **Consistency**: Ensures regular, timely meals without daily ordering hassle

3. **Nutrition**: Focuses on balanced, home-style meals suitable for daily consumption
4. **Convenience**: Eliminates meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking chores
5. **Reliability**: Builds a dependable food routine with trusted local meal providers

## Unique Value Proposition

- **Student-Centric Design**: UI/UX specifically tailored to student needs and use cases
- **Flexible Subscription Management**: Easy options to pause, modify or customize meal plans
