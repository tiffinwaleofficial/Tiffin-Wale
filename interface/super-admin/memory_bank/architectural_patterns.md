**7. Architectural Patterns in use:**

*   **Modular Architecture**: Well-organized `src` directory with clear separation of concerns (app, components, context, firebase, hooks, lib).
*   **Frontend-Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Heavy reliance on Firebase for authentication and database.
*   **Next.js App Router**: Modern framework for full-stack web development, including routing, layouts, and server/client components.
*   **Component-Based UI**: React and ShadCN UI for building reusable and maintainable UI.
*   **Client-Side Data Fetching**: `@tanstack/react-query` for efficient data management.
*   **Edge Authentication**: Next.js middleware combined with `next-firebase-auth-edge` for secure authentication.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented for admin user management.
*   **Context API**: For global state management.
*   **Custom Hooks**: For encapsulating and reusing logic.
*   **Real-time Data**: Firebase Firestore's real-time capabilities.
*   **AI Integration**: Genkit AI for potential AI-powered features.
*   **Environment-based Configuration**: Flexible configuration management.
*   **Google App Engine Deployment**: Cloud-native deployment strategy.
