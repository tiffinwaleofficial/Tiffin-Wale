# **App Name**: Tiffin Admin Pro

## Core Features:

- Admin Login: Implement a login page with email and password fields, and a 'Login as Admin' CTA.
- Dashboard Overview: Design a dashboard with metrics cards (Daily Orders, Active Subscriptions, Active Partners, Total Revenue), charts (Orders Trend, Revenue Graph, Partner Growth), and a latest activities section.
- Manage Partners: Create a table to manage partners (tiffin centers) with view profile, approve/ban, and contact actions. Include filters for city, active/inactive status, and registered date.
- Manage Customers: Develop a table to manage customers (students/users) with details like Name, Mobile, City, Subscription Type, and Status. Actions include View, Ban, and Contact.
- Manage Orders: Implement an orders table with filters to view tiffin details (Lunch/Dinner), status, delivery partner, and dispatch status. Allow manual updates to delivery status.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a professional and calming blue (#3498db) for the main interface elements.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#f4f4f4) for backgrounds and card layouts to ensure a clean and modern look.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) for positive actions like approve and update, and red (#e74c3c) for negative actions like ban and delete.
- Use clean and readable sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Employ Lucide, Tabler Icons, or FontAwesome for consistent and clear icons throughout the dashboard.
- Use card-based layouts, tables with pagination, and modals for edit/view actions to improve UX. Implement a sidebar with a collapsible menu and a top navbar.
- Subtle transitions and animations for actions like opening modals, updating data, and toggling between light and dark modes.
