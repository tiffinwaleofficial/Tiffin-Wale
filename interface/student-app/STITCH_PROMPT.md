## 🎯 MISSION
Design a **next-level modern, visually stunning mobile app** for TiffinWale - a food subscription service for students. Create something that looks **premium, contemporary, and absolutely beautiful**.

## 🎨 DESIGN DIRECTION

### Visual Aesthetic Goal:
- **Modern & Premium**: Think iOS 17, Material Design 3, or premium food apps like Uber Eats/DoorDash

  - Gradient backgrounds (subtle or bold)
  - Dark mode options or sophisticated dark themes
  - Vibrant accent colors (purples, teals, corals, deep blues)
  - Modern color combinations that feel fresh and appetizing
- **Food-Appropriate**: Warm, inviting colors that make food look appetizing

### Color Philosophy:
**DO NOT** use simple orange/cream. Instead:
- Explore modern gradients (sunset oranges to pinks, deep purples to blues)

- Make it Instagram-worthy and shareable
